# Flatiron-Project-5

This project involved downloading Seattle police data for arrests following Terry Stops. This file contains demographic information on both the officer and the suject, and the outcome of the stop (which has been processed to be 'arrested' or 'not arrested'). Several Machine Learning algorithms are used to analyze the data, including Decision Trees, Bagged Trees and Random Forests. The best algorithm with the best hyperparameters is found, results are interpretted, and artificial testing data is fed into the new algorithm to check for biases.
